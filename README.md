â€¢	Sea Battle

Almost everyone knows the game Sea Battle; it's quite popular. In my case, this game is designed for two players, if you're playing on the same computer. First, one player lines up their ships, then the other, and then you take turns attacking. This game uses JavaFX.
The game starts with the "Start Game" button.

Afterwards, players are asked to arrange their ships in the desired order. To rotate the king 90 degrees, right-click on it. This game does not allow ships to be placed adjacent to each other.

After placing your ships, you and your friend can begin attacking. If you hit an enemy ship, you must continue attacking until you miss. If you miss, the cell will be marked blue. If a ship was hit but not destroyed, the cell will be marked with a cross. If a ship was destroyed, it will be highlighted in red and all the cells around it will be highlighted in blue.

If all of one player's ships are killed, a message will be displayed on the screen indicating the victory of one or the other player.
